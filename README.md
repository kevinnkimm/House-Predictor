# 🏡 California Housing Price Prediction

This project uses the California Housing dataset to build a simple machine learning model that predicts median house prices based on features such as income, population, number of rooms, and house age.

The goal of this project is to practice the full machine learning workflow, including:

- Loading and exploring data
- Cleaning missing values
- Selecting useful features
- Scaling numerical values
- Training a regression model
- Evaluating the model’s accuracy

## 📊 Project Summary

- **Task:** Predict housing prices
- **Model Used:** Linear Regression (baseline model)
- **Evaluation Metric:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- **Current Score:** ~60,000
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Jupyter/Kaggle Notebook

## 🔍 What This Project Covers

- Understanding the structure of the dataset
- Basic exploratory data analysis
- Handling missing values
- Dropping or encoding categorical columns
- Splitting data into training/testing sets
- Scaling features
- Training a regression model
- Checking model performance

## 📈 Key Insight

Median income is the strongest predictor of home price.
A baseline model gives an MAE around **$60k**, which can be improved through:

- Feature engineering
- More advanced models
- Hyperparameter tuning

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Engineer additional features
- Try Random Forests or Gradient Boosting
- Use cross-validation
- Tune hyperparameters
- Add visualizations
